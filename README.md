## Comments

I really enjoyed this coding challenge. I could have added Redux but think it's fine without it. 
Also should have/ would like to have had more time to add unit-tests with Enzyme.

## Things to Improve

* Switch images bases on size of device.
* Clean up `scss` property order
* Minify `js` and `css` files
